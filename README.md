An Android app to enable networking for new immigrants. It judges compatibility not by looks, as most apps do, but by similarities in upbringing and personality. It uses an algorithm with weights to judge which person would be more compatible with another.
Some of its features are:

- Implementation with Firebase for profile picture storage, account information, and account authentication.
- It hosts its own direct messaging system with history and real-time updates.
- It recommends more compatible users through algorithms.
- It showcases a clean and custom UI that is readable and easy to navigate.
- Implements its own friend system where friend requests can be sent and declined.
- Users can be blocked for further protection.
- It features a profile editing page where users can edit their own information and store it on the cloud.
